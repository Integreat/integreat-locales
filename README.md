# Locales for the Integreat frontend

## Origin

This repository is the result of a merge of the locales between the webapp project and the react-native project. The base for the locales is the file `src/locales` from the integreat-react-native project. It was copied on on 04-09-2018 the from the integreat-webapp project.
All changes after 04-09-2018 have been reapplied to the locales.json such that no locale changes are missing. The patches can be found in `origin`.
